May 31, 2007, version 1.0

    * Overview:  this is the first clean release of KLU.  Only one bug was
	fixed since in the last pre-1.0 version (see below).  This release adds
	a 64-bit version, a better Demo, a 100% statement coverage test, new
	parameters and statistics in the KLU Common object, reduced memory
	usage, a method for limiting worst-case work in the BTF ordering, and a
	completely redesigned MATLAB interface.

    * scaling default changed from no scaling, to max row scaling

    * C-callable API modified for klu_malloc, klu_free, klu_realloc, klu_rcond,
	klu_rgrowth, klu_condest.  API of other user-callable KLU functions not
	modified.

    * user ordering function prototype modified (final argument is now
	klu_common, not Common->user_data)

    * User Guide added.

    * KLU Demo completely rewritten.  Now depends on CHOLMOD to read in its
	matrices, in Matrix Market format.

    * port to 64-bit version

    * reduction in memory usage, particularly when the BTF form results in
	many small diagonal blocks

    * new Common parameter (maxwork) and statistics (work, memusage, mempeak)

    * Makefile and object files (*.o) now placed in KLU/Lib, not KLU/Source

    * added klu_install.m, klu_demo.m, klu_make.m to KLU/MATLAB.

    * klu mexFunction now returns a struct for LU, not a lengthy list of
	matrices.  MATLAB interface completely rewritten.

    * Tcov tests completely rewritten

    * bug fix in complex klu_z_refactor, when both btf and scaling are in use

    * bug fix in klu_rgrowth, when the matrix is scaled

Dec 12, 2006: version 0.11

    * minor MATLAB cleanup

Jan 25, 2011: version 2.0.1

    * minor fix to "make install"

Nov 30, 2009: version 2.0.0

    * rewrote the entire package in C.  The advantage is that the code is
	now more portable.  It does not rely on a Fortran compiler that
	supports the non-standard %val construct.  The minor disadvantage is
	it can no longer read older Harwell/Boeing matrices if the Fortran
	format they use does not put at least one space between the values.
	The Rutherford/Boeing format does require at least one space, so the
	package can read any Rutherford/Boeing matrix.  No changes to MATLAB
	m-file interface.

May 1, 2009: version 1.1.2

    * minor change to RBmake.m to compile 64-bit version

Nov 1, 2007: version 1.1.1

    * minor lint cleanup

May 31, 2007: version 1.1

    * port to 64-bit MATLAB.  Tested on Linux 32-bit and 64-bit.  Not tested on
	Windows, since I do not have a Fortran compiler on that platform.

Dec 1, 2006: version 1.0 released

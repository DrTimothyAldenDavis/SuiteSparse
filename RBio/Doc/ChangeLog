    * cmake updates: SuiteSparse:: namespace by Markus Muetzel

June 16, 2023: version 4.0.0

    * revised API: declaring many input parameters as const.  This is a minor
        change that might be both API and ABI compatible with v3.x, but is
        user-visible so the major version number is increased from 3.x to 4.x.
        update by Markus Muetzel

        No change to C code except version number

Oct 10, 2014: version 2.2.1

July 31, 2013: version 2.2.0

    * changed malloc and printf pointers to use SuiteSparse_config

Jun 20, 2012: verison 2.1.1

    * minor update for Windows (removed filesep)

Jun 1, 2012: version 2.1.0

    * changed from UFconfig to SuiteSparse_config

Dec 7, 2011: version 2.0.2

    * fixed the Makefile to better align with CFLAGS and other standards
    * added more detailed error message to mexFunction

Jan 25, 2011: version 2.0.1

    * minor fix to "make install"

Nov 30, 2009: version 2.0.0

    * rewrote the entire package in C.  The advantage is that the code is
	now more portable.  It does not rely on a Fortran compiler that
	supports the non-standard %val construct.  The minor disadvantage is
	it can no longer read older Harwell/Boeing matrices if the Fortran
	format they use does not put at least one space between the values.
	The Rutherford/Boeing format does require at least one space, so the
	package can read any Rutherford/Boeing matrix.  No changes to MATLAB
	m-file interface.

May 1, 2009: version 1.1.2

    * minor change to RBmake.m to compile 64-bit version

Nov 1, 2007: version 1.1.1

    * minor lint cleanup

May 31, 2007: version 1.1

    * port to 64-bit MATLAB.  Tested on Linux 32-bit and 64-bit.  Not tested on
	Windows, since I do not have a Fortran compiler on that platform.

Dec 1, 2006: version 1.0 released

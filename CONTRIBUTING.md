# Contributing to SuiteSparse

To add an issue for a bug report (gasp!) or a feature request,
you can use the issue tracker on github.com, at
[`https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/issues`]
(https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/issues).

To contribute code, you can submit a pull request.  To do so,
you must first agree to the Contributor License
in the [`Contributor_License`](Contributor_License) folder.
Sign and date it the PDF, and email it to me at
DrTimothyAldenDavis@gmail.com.  Pull requests will only be
included into SuiteSparse after I receive your email with
the signed PDF.

Do not submit a pull request to the default branch.
Instead, use the dev2 branch.

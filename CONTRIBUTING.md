# Contributing to SuiteSparse

To add an issue for a bug report (gasp!) or a feature request,
you can use the issue tracker on github.com, at
[`https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/issues`]
(https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/issues).

To contribute code, you can submit a pull request.  To do so,
you must first agree to the Contributor License Agreement
[`CONTRIBUTOR-LICENSE.txt`](CONTRIBUTOR-LICENSE.txt).
Print a copy of the txt file (as a PDF), sign and date it,
and email it to me at DrTimothyAldenDavis@gmail.com.  Pull
requests will only be included into SuiteSparse after I receive
your email with the signed PDF.

function [varargout] = jit (varargin)
%JIT controls the GraphBLAS JIT
%
%   status = GrB.jit ;                      % current status of the JIT
%   status = GrB.jit (status) ;             % control the JIT and get its status
%   [status,path] = GrB.jit (status,path) ; % get/set JIT cache path
%
% The GraphBLAS JIT allows GraphBLAS to compile new kernels at run-time that
% are specifically tuned for the particular operators, types, and matrix
% formats.  Without the JIT, only a selected combination of these options are
% computed with high-performance kernels.
%
% GrB.jit controls the GraphBLAS JIT.  Its input/ouput status is a string:
%
%   ''          leave the JIT control unchanged.
%   'off'       do not use the JIT, and free any loaded JIT kernels.
%   'pause'     do not run JIT kernels but keep any already loaded.
%   'run'       run JIT kernels if already loaded; no load/compile.
%   'load'      able to load and run JIT kernels; may not compile.
%   'on'        full JIT: able to compile, load, and run.
%   'flush'     clear all loaded JIT kernels, then turn the JIT on;
%               (the same as GrB.jit ('off') ; GrB.jit ('on')).
%
% The 2nd input/output parameter is a string that defines the JIT cache path.
% If you run multiple instances of MATLAB at the same time, each must use a
% different cache folder, but parallel threads within the same instance of
% MATLAB share the same jit folder.  The default cache on Linux/Mac is
% ~/.SuiteSparse/GrB10.4.0 (for GraphBLAS v10.4.0 for example).  On Windows, it
% is located inside your AppData\Local folder.  If you change to another
% location, adding the GraphBLAS version is recommended; see the last example
% below.
%
% Refer to the GraphBLAS User Guide for details (GxB_JIT_C_CONTROL and
% GxB_JIT_CACHE_PATH).
%
% Example:
%
%   [status] = GrB.jit
%   [status] = GrB.jit ('on')
%   [status,path] = GrB.jit
%   [status,path] = GrB.jit ('on', [userpath filesep 'my_other_cache')
%
%   % setting the JIT cache path with the GraphBLAS version included:
%   v = GrB.ver
%   [status,path] = GrB.jit ('on', [userpath filesep 'myGrB' v.Version])
%

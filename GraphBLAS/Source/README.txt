This folder, GraphBLAS/Source, contains all the primary source files for
GraphBLAS, and internal include files that are meant for internal inclusion in
GraphBLAS itself.  They should not be included in end-user applications.

The Source/*/template/* files are not compiled separately, but are #include'd
into files in this folder instead.  The are templatized source files.  The
Source/*/include/* files are header files for template methods.  Both template
and include files are merged into the JITpackage and then exported to
~/.SuiteSparse/GrB.x.y.z/src.

Source/*/factory/* files are not used in the JIT.

aliased             methods for determining if any components of a matrix
                    are aliased (shared) with another matrix.  Such a matrix
                    is called shallow (an array such as A->i is shallow
                    if A->i_shallow is true, and is owned by another matrix).
                    Such matrices are never returned to the user; they are
                    only internal.

callback            JIT kernels are not linked against -lgraphblas and thus
                    cannot call back into GraphBLAS directly.  Instead, a
                    struct containing function pointers to various utility
                    functions is passed to each JIT kernel.

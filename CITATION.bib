abstract = {SuiteSparseQR is a sparse QR factorization package based on the multifrontal method. Within each frontal matrix, LAPACK and the multithreaded BLAS enable the method to obtain high performance on multicore architectures. Parallelism across different frontal matrices is handled with Intel's Threading Building Blocks library. The symbolic analysis and ordering phase pre-eliminates singletons by permuting the input matrix A into the form [R11 R12; 0 A22] where R11 is upper triangular with diagonal entries above a given tolerance. Next, the fill-reducing ordering, column elimination tree, and frontal matrix structures are found without requiring the formation of the pattern of ATA. Approximate rank-detection is performed within each frontal matrix using Heath's method. While Heath's method is not always exact, it has the advantage of not requiring column pivoting and thus does not interfere with the fill-reducing ordering. For sufficiently large problems, the resulting sparse QR factorization obtains a substantial fraction of the theoretical peak performance of a multicore computer.},

abstract = {Sparse factorization is a fundamental tool in scientific computing. As the major component of a sparse direct solver, it represents the dominant computational cost for many analyses. For factorizations which involve sufficient dense math, the substantial computational capability provided by GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) can help alleviate this cost. However, for many other cases, the prevalence of small/irregular dense math and the relatively slow communication between the host and device over the PCIe bus, make it challenging to significantly accelerate sparse factorization using the GPU. In this paper we describe a left-looking supernodal Cholesky factorization algorithm which permits improved utilization of the GPU when factoring sparse matrices. The central idea is to stream subtrees of the elimination tree through the GPU and perform the factorization of each subtree entirely on the GPU. This avoids the majority of the PCIe communication without the need for a complex task scheduler. Importantly, within these subtrees, many independent, small, dense operations are batched to minimize kernel launch overhead and many of these batched kernels are executed concurrently to maximize device utilization. Performance results for commonly studied matrices are presented along with suggested actions for further optimization.}

abstract = {Sparse Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting computes the factorization PAQ = LU of a sparse matrix A, where the row ordering P is selected during factorization using standard partial pivoting with row interchanges. The goal is to select a column preordering, Q, based solely on the nonzero pattern of A, that limits the worst-case number of nonzeros in the factorization. The fill-in also depends on P, but Q is selected to reduce an upper bound on the fill-in for any subsequent choice of P. The choice of Q can have a dramatic impact on the number of nonzeros in L and U. One scheme for determining a good column ordering for A is to compute a symmetric ordering that reduces fill-in in the Cholesky factorization of ATA. A conventional minimum degree ordering algorithm would require the sparsity structure of ATA to be computed, which can be expensive both in terms of space and time since ATA may be much denser than A. An alternative is to compute Q directly from the sparsity structure of A; this strategy is used by MATLAB's COLMMD preordering algorithm. A new ordering algorithm, COLAMD, is presented. It is based on the same strategy but uses a better ordering heuristic. COLAMD is faster and computes better orderings, with fewer nonzeros in the factors of the matrix.},

In the multifrontal method, work on a frontal matrix can be suspended, the frontal matrix can be stored for later reuse, and a new frontal matrix can be generated. There are thus several frontal matrices stored during the factorization, and one or more of these are assembled (summed) when creating a new frontal matrix. Although this means that arbitrary sparsity patterns can be handled efficiently, extra work is required to sum the frontal matrices together and can be costly because indirect addressing is requred. The (uni)frontal method avoids this extra work by factorizing the matrix with a single frontal matrix. Rows and columns are added  to the frontal matrix, and pivot rows and columns are removed. Data movement is simpler, but higher fill-in can result if the matrix cannot be permuted into a variable-band form with small profile. We consider a combined unifrontal/multifrontal algorithm to enable general fill-in reduction orderings to be applied without the data movement of previous multifrontal approaches.  We discuss this technique in the context of a code designed for the solution of sparse systems with unsymmetric pattern.},

For symmetric problems, methods such as the multifrontal method avoid indirect addressing in the innermost loops by using dense matrix kernels. However, no efficient LU factorization algorithm based primarily on dense matrix kernels exists for matrices whose pattern is very unsymmetric. We address this deficiency and present a new unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method based on dense matrix kernels. As in the classical multifrontal method, advantage is taken of repetitive structure in the matrix by factorizing more than one pivot in each frontal matrix, thus enabling the use of Level 2 and Level 3 BLAS. The performance is compared with the classical multifrontal method and other unsymmetric solvers on a CRAY C-98. }

It is a meta-algorithm that selects the best factorization method for a particular matrix, whether sparse or dense. However, the simplicity and elegance of its single-character interface prohibits the reuse of its factorization for subsequent systems. Requiring MATLAB users to find the best factorization method on their own can lead to suboptimal choices; even MATLAB experts can make the wrong choice. Furthermore, naive MATLAB users have a tendency to translate mathematical expressions from linear algebra directly into MATLAB, so that x = A-1b becomes the inferior yet all-to-prevalent x=inv(A)*b. To address these issues, an object-oriented FACTORIZE method is presented. Via simple-to-use operator overloading, solving two linear systems can be written as F=factorize(A); x=Fb; y=Fc, where A is factorized only once. The selection of the best factorization method (LU, Cholesky, LDLT, QR, or a complete orthogonal decomposition for rank-deficient matrices) is hidden from the user. The mathematical expression x = A-1b directly translates into the MATLAB expression x=inverse(A)*b, which does not compute the inverse at all, but does the right thing by factorizing A and solving the corresponding triangular systems.},

abstract = {KLU is a software package for solving sparse unsymmetric linear systems of equations that arise in circuit simulation applications. It relies on a permutation to Block Triangular Form (BTF), several methods for finding a fill-reducing ordering (variants of approximate minimum degree and nested dissection), and Gilbert/Peierls’ sparse left-looking LU factorization algorithm to factorize each block. The package is written in C and includes a MATLAB interface. Performance results comparing KLU with SuperLU, Sparse 1.3, and UMFPACK on circuit simulation matrices are presented. KLU is the default sparse direct solver in the XyceTMcircuit simulation package developed by Sandia National Laboratories.},

abstract = {The LDL software package is a set of short, concise routines for factorizing symmetric positive-definite sparse matrices, with some applicability to symmetric indefinite matrices. Its primary purpose is to illustrate much of the basic theory of sparse matrix algorithms in as concise a code as possible, including an elegant method of sparse symmetric factorization that computes the factorization row-by-row but stores it column-by-column. The entire symbolic and numeric factorization consists of less than 50 executable lines of code. The package is written in C, and includes a MATLAB interface.},

abstract = {We describe the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB™, Mathematica™, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.},

abstract = {The SPQR_RANK package contains routines that calculate the numerical rank of large, sparse, numerically rank-deficient matrices. The routines can also calculate orthonormal bases for numerical null spaces, approximate pseudoinverse solutions to least squares problems involving rank-deficient matrices, and basic solutions to these problems. The algorithms are based on SPQR from SuiteSparseQR (ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 38, Article 8, 2011). SPQR is a high-performance routine for forming QR factorizations of large, sparse matrices. It returns an estimate for the numerical rank that is usually, but not always, correct. The new routines improve the accuracy of the numerical rank calculated by SPQR and reliably determine the numerical rank in the sense that, based on extensive testing with matrices from applications, the numerical rank is almost always accurately determined when our methods report that the numerical rank should be correct. Reliable determination of numerical rank is critical to the other calculations in the package. The routines work well for matrices with either small or large null space dimensions.},

In this article, we introduce Mongoose, a multilevel hybrid graph partitioning algorithm and library. Building on previous work in multilevel partitioning frameworks and combinatoric approaches, we introduce novel stall-reducing and stall-free coarsening strategies, as well as an efficient hybrid algorithm leveraging (1) traditional combinatoric methods and (2) continuous quadratic programming formulations. We demonstrate how this new hybrid algorithm outperforms either strategy in isolation, and we also compare Mongoose to METIS and demonstrate its effectiveness on large and social networking (power law) graphs.},

abstract = {SPEX Left LU is a software package for exactly solving unsymmetric sparse linear systems. As a component of the sparse exact (SPEX) software package, SPEX Left LU can be applied to any input matrix, A, whose entries are integral, rational, or decimal, and provides a solution to the system Ax = b which is either exact or accurate to user-specified precision. SPEX Left LU preorders the matrix A with a user-specified fill-reducing ordering and computes a left-looking LU factorization with the special property that each operation used to compute the L and U matrices is integral. Notable additional applications of this package include benchmarking the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art linear solvers, and determining whether singular-to-double-precision matrices are indeed singular. Computationally, this paper evaluates the impact of several novel pivoting schemes in exact arithmetic, benchmarks the exact iterative solvers within Linbox, and benchmarks the accuracy of MATLAB sparse backslash. Most importantly, it is shown that SPEX Left LU outperforms the exact iterative solvers in run time on easy instances and in stability as the iterative solver fails on a sizeable subset of the tested (both easy and hard) instances. The SPEX Left LU package is written in ANSI C, comes with a MATLAB interface, and is distributed via GitHub, as a component of the SPEX software package, and as a component of SuiteSparse.},

Dec 12, 2006, version 1.4.0

    * added support for large files (larger than 2GB)

    * minor MATLAB cleanup

    * renamed MATLAB function from cholmod to cholmod2, to avoid filename clash
	with itself (the built-in version of cholmod).

Dec 2, 2006, version 1.3.0

    * Major modification to cholmod_read.c; now fully supports all forms of the
	Matrix Market format.  Added cholmod_read_dense and cholmod_read_matrix
	functions to cholmod_read.c.  Major changes to mread MATLAB function.
	Added Common->prefer_binary option for cholmod_read.

    * Added cholmod_write.c (cholmod_write_sparse and cholmod_write_dense
	functions).  Added mwrite MATLAB function.

    * Added 2nd output argument to sparse2 (Z, binary pattern of explicit
	zero entries).

    * Added the function cholmod_symmetry to the MatrixOps module.
	Added spsym MATLAB function.

    * 2nd argument to cholmod_triplet_to_sparse changed from int to size_t.

    * minor correction to cholmod_analyze_ordering, cholmod_dense.c

    * minor change to cholmod_rowfac.c, cholmod_solve.c, ...
	to allow for easier testing.

Sept 28, 2006, version 1.2.1

    * bug fix to cholmod_matlab.c, when working with sparse INT64 matrices
	in the "sparse2" function

Aug 31, 2006, version 1.2

    * Common->default_nesdis parameter and Common->called_nd statistic added.
	Otherwise, no change to user interface.  v1.2 is fully upward
	compatible with v1.1 (even binary compatible).

    * non-supernodal Lx=b and L'x=b solves simplified, slight increase in
	performance.

    * update/downdate performance improved.

    * ordering options and output statistics added to MATLAB/cholmod
	mexFunction.

July 27, 2006, version 1.1.1

    * bug fix for cholmod_rowfac_mask, for the complex case.  Has no
	effect on MATLAB.

June 27, 2006:

    * trivial changes to nested dissection code, and cholmod_read.c (for
	debugging, and to add explicit typecasts so compilers don't complain).

May, 2006:

    * Added new routines for LPDASA: cholmod_rowfac_mask, cholmod_updown_mask.
	Added cholmod_collapse_septree.  Added nd_oksep, nd_components
	parameters to Common.

Apr 30, 2006: version 1.1

    * added interface to CAMD.  cholmod_nested_dissection can now call
	CCOLAMD, CSYMAMD, and CAMD.  Common->nd_camd usage extended.
	New argument added to nesdis mexFunction.  New cholmod_camd function
	added.  No other changes to CHOLMOD user interface.

    * more careful integer overflow checks.  Added non-user-callable functions
	to add and multiply size_t integers, with overflow checks.

    * added Common->no_workspace_reallocate

    * flop count is now correct for A*A' case (Common->rowfacfl).

Jan 18, 2006: version 1.0.2

    * bug fix: MATLAB interface incorrect for full logical matrices.

    * Tcov tests modified to generate fewer intentional nan's, to make it
	easier to look for errors in BLAS libraries that incorrectly
	generate nan's.

Dec 16, 2005: version 1.0.1

    * bug fix: cholmod_amd allocated too small of a workspace when ordering A*A'

Dec 8, 2005: version 1.0

    * no real changes.  Version 1.0 is the same as version 0.8.  Version 1.0 is
	simply the formal stable release.

    * known issue:  the floating point operation count, Common->rowfacfl, is
	statistic is incorrect when factorizing A*A'.  This will be fixed in
	version 1.1.

Nov 15, 2005: version 0.8

    * bug fix in t_cholmod_super_numeric, for [R,p]=chol(A) usage.

    * Common->quick_return_if_not_posdef added.

    * Added cholmod_row_lsubtree (required for LPDASA)

    * bug fix: cholmod_rcond returned sqrt(1/cond) for an LL' factorization;
	1/cond is required.

    * new statistics added: flop counts for cholmod_rowfac, # of factor column
	reallocations, # of factor reallocations due to column reallocations,
	and # of times the (non-default) bounds on diag(L) are hit.

    * factor column reallocation skipped if space already big enough.

    * bug fix: cholmod_copy_factor did not copy L->is_monotonic.

    * bug fix: cholmod_change_factor (diagonal entry was wrong in one case)

    * rcond added to cholmod mexFunction ([x,rcond] = cholmod(A,b)).

    * cholmod_rowadd, cholmod_rowdel modified.  rowdel no longer removes
	entries from the matrix; it sets them to zero instead.

Oct 10, 2005: version 0.7

    * minor changes:  minor change to Check/cholmod_check.c (coerce
	sizeof(...) to (int) when printing. Less strict check on A->p for
	unpacked matrices) , removed a few unused variables in
	Check/cholmod_read.c and Demo/cholmod*demo.c, changed "exit(0)" to
	"return(0)" in Demo/cholmod_simple.c.  Changed Makefile so that "." is
	not assumed to be on the $path.  Added Cygwin to architecture detection
	in Include/cholmod_blas.h.  Added cparent and cmember to nesdis.m.
	Space for future expansion added to cholmod_common.

    * removed "rowmark" from the Modify module, which affects how partial
	updates to Lx=b solves are done during update/downdate.  Should only
	affect LPDASA.

    * added CHOLMOD_SUBSUB_VERSION

Aug 31, 2005:  version 0.6 released.

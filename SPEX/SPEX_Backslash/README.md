SPEX_Backslash is software package used to solve a sparse systems of linear
equations.
exactly using Integer-Preserving factorizations.

*********SPEX_Backslash*********
Purpose: Exactly solve a sparse system of linear equations using a given input
         matrix and right hand side vector file. This code can output the final
         solution to a user specified output file in either double precision or
         full precision rational numbers. If you intend to use SPEX_Backslash
         within another program, refer to examples for help with this.

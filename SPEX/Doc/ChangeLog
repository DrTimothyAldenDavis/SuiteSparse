Aug 20, 2024: version 3.2.1

    * Python interface: bug fix for string length, and Python Inf

July 2, 2024: version 3.2.0

    * added SPEX_ldl_* methods: allowing D to have negative diagonal entries;
        SPEX_cholesky_* methods revised to require D to have positive entries.
    * SPEX_USE_PYTHON: cmake option added
    * minor update to MATLAB interface: for Mac, with MATLAB R2024a
        on Apple Silicon (native app)

Mar 22, 2024: version 3.1.0

    * major update to build system
    * Added new methods to SPEX.h, available to the end user:
        SPEX_TRY
        SPEX_CATCH
        SPEX_1D
        SPEX_2D
        SPEX_mpz_set_null
        SPEX_mpq_set_null
        SPEX_mpfr_set_null
        SPEX_mpz_clear
        SPEX_mpq_clear
        SPEX_mpfr_clear
        SPEX_mpfr_set_proc

Jul 26, 2023: version 3.0.0

    * major change to the API: new SPEX_factorization and SPEX_symbolic_analysis
        objects.  Uniform analyze/factorize/solve functions for all kinds of 
        factorizations.
    * thread-safe: SPEX 2.0 was not thread-safe if the user application called 
        it in parallel; v3.0 is now thread-safe with SPEX_thread_initialize
        and SPEX_thread_finalize.
    * SPEX_Cholesky: robust implementation of sparse REF Cholesky.
    * SPEX_Backslash: automatically determines (between SPEX LU and SPEX
        Cholesky) the best exact algorithm to use when solving a SLE.
    * python interface: SPEX can now be used to solve SLEs in python with only
        one line. There are separate functions for SPEX LU, SPEX Cholesky and 
        SPEX Backslash.
    * MATLAB interface: SPEX can now be used to solve SLEs in MATLAB with only
        one line. There are separate functions for SPEX LU, SPEX Cholesky and 
        SPEX Backslash.

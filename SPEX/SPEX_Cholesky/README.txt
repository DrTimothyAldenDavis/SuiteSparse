SPEX_Cholesky is software package used to solve a sparse SPD linear systems exactly using the Sparse Cholesky factorization. It comprises both an integer-preserving up-looking and integer-preserving left-looking Cholesky factorization.

*********SPEX_Cholesky*********
Purpose: Exactly solve an SPD sparse system of linear equations using a given
         input matrix and right hand side vector file. This code can output the
         final solution to a user specified output file in either double
         precision or full precision rational numbers. If you intend to use
         SPEX_Cholesky within another program, refer to examples for help with
         this.

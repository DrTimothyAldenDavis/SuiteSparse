SPEX_Cholesky is software package used to solve a sparse SPD or symmetric
negative definite and symmetric indefinite with nonzero leading principle
minors linear systems exactly using the Sparse Cholesky factorization. It
comprises both an integer-preserving up-looking and integer-preserving
left-looking Cholesky and LDL factorization

*********SPEX_cholesky*********
Purpose: Exactly solve an SPD sparse system of linear equations using a given
         input matrix and right hand side vector file. This code can output the
         final solution to a user specified output file in either double
         precision or full precision rational numbers. If you intend to use
         SPEX_cholesky within another program, refer to examples for help with
         this.

*********SPEX_ldl*********
Purpose: Exactly solve a symmetric system of equations with nonzero leading
         principle minors. This code can output the
         final solution to a user specified output file in either double
         precision or full precision rational numbers. If you intend to use
         SPEX_ldl within another program, refer to examples for help with
         this.

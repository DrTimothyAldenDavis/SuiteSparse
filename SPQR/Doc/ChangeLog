Sept 18, 2023: version 4.2.1

    * cmake update: add "None" build type, from Antonio Rojas, for Arch Linux

Sept 8, 2023: version 4.2.0

    * cmake updates: SuiteSparse:: namespace by Markus Muetzel

    * SuiteSparse_config: now v7.0.0

Dec 9, 2022: version 3.0.2

    * minor change to build system
    * Fortan: no longer required to build SPQR
    * CHOLMOD interface: CHOLMOD may be compiled with or without
        -DNPARTITION.  This now has no effect on how SPQR is compiled.  CHOLMOD
        will not be able to provide METIS orderings, and returns the error
        code CHOLMOD_NOT_INSTALLED if METIS is used, at run-time.

Nov 12, 2022: version 3.0.1

    * BLAS definitions: no longer exposed to the user application

Nov 12, 2022: version 3.0.0

    * using CMake build system
    * integers: int (32-bit) and SuiteSparse_long (nominally 64-bit) replaced
        with int32_t and int64_t.
    * BLAS/LAPACK: relying on SuiteSparse_config and CMake to find and link
        with the BLAS and LAPACK libraries
    * CUDA support: moved to libspqr_cuda.so library.

Mar 6, 2022: version 2.1.0

    * TBB disabled: TBB was a non-default option in SPQR that is no longer
        avialable.  The TBB feature used by SPQR is no longer provided in
        recent updates to TBB itself.

Dec 28, 2018: version 2.0.9

    * SuiteSparseQR.hpp: changed where CUDA files are #include'd,
	controlled by SUITESPARSE_GPU_EXTERN_ON (see also CHOLMOD).

Dec 8, 2016: version 2.0.8

    * minor changes to documentation and compile scripts
        for submitting SPQR to ACM TOMS.  No changes to code
        except version numbers in include files.

May 4, 2016: version 2.0.7

    * minor changes to Makefile

Apr 1, 2016: version 2.0.6

    * licensing simplified (no other change); refer to SPQR/Doc/License.txt

Feb 1, 2016: version 2.0.5

    * update to Makefiles
    * better error handling when only some modules are used in CHOLMOD.
	SuiteSparseQR requires the CHOLMOD/Supernodal module.  This is now
	checked both at compile time and at run time.

Jan 30, 2016: versions 2.0.4

    * modifications to Makefiles
    * correction to mexFunctions required for MATLAB R2015b,
	for sparse empty matrices and NULL mxGetPr
    * added "#include <algorithm>" to spqr_tol.cpp.

Jan 1, 2016: version 2.0.3

    * modified Makefile to create shared libraries
        No change to C code except version number

Aug 28, 2015: version 2.0.2

    * changed the default tol when A has inf's

Mar 24, 2015: version 2.0.1

    * minor changes to documentation

Oct 17, 2014: version 2.0.0

    * MAJOR UPDATE:  added GPU support.  Up to 11x faster than CPU version.

July 18, 2014: version 1.3.3

    * minor change to SPQR/Demo/Makefile, for the case when CHOLMOD is compiled
        with the GPU.  No changes to the SPQR library code itself.

Aug 22, 2013: version 1.3.2

    * changed malloc, printf, hypot, and divcomplex pointers to use
        SuiteSparse_config

Jun 20, 2012: verison 1.3.1

    * minor update for Windows (removed filesep)

Jun 1, 2012: version 1.3.0

    * changed from UFconfig to SuiteSparse_config
    * removed -DTIMING option.  Timing is now enabled by default.
    * added SuiteSparse_tic, SuiteSparse_toc, SuiteSparse_time timing functions
    * spqr_time removed (use SuiteSparse_time instead)

Dec 7, 2011: version 1.2.3

    * fixed the Makefile to better align with CFLAGS and other standards
    * minor fix to SPQR/MATLAB/spqr_make.m
    * Makefile now detects whether or not METIS is present, and
        sets -DNPARTITION if it is not

May 10, 2011: version 1.2.2

    * minor fix to SPQR/Include/SuiteSparseQR_C.h to accomodate the mixing
        of C/C++ with a particular compiler  

Jan 25, 2011: version 1.2.1

    * minor fix to "make install"
    * added more examples to SPRQ/Demo/qrdemo.cpp
    * fixed error-condition return value for Source/SuiteSparseQR.cpp
    * minor fix to SPQR/Tcov/qrtest.cpp

Nov 30, 2009: version 1.2.0

    * fixed interface to 64-bit BLAS for MATLAB 7.8
    * added "make install" and "make uninstall"
    * added info struct output to spqr mexFunction
    * added 2-norm of w statistic
    * changed default ordering back to always use COLAMD.  Default in v1.1.2
        and v1.1.1 was to use COLAMD if m < 2*n and use AMD(A'A)
        or METIS(A'A) otherwise.

May 1, 2009, version 1.1.2

    * added more examples to user guide and to spqr.m
    * removed "static" declaration of functions in Source/* files.  This
	corrects a problem with the Mac OS compiler.

Mar 24, 2009, version 1.1.1

    * #include <cstring> added to SPQR/Include/spqr.hpp, required
        by gcc 4.3.2 (but not needed by gcc 4.1.0 or other compilers...).

Sept 20, 2008, version 1.1.0

    * No bugs fixed since no known bugs were present in v1.0.0
    * Added new ordering options, in particular the default ordering:
        - COLAMD if m <= 2*n after removing singletons; otherwise:
          AMD then try METIS if installed and if AMD gives a high fill-in
          and flop count.
    * User Guide, and two draft journal articles (to be submitted to ACM TOMS)
           in the SPQR/Doc directory.
    * Added control of the # of threads used by TBB (it was set
	to the TBB default in version 1.0.0).
    * Additional demos.
    * Added -DTIMING option, and additional components to info output
    * Added spqr_singletons mexFunction
    * Modified example in comments of spqr_assemble.cpp to coincide with article

Aug 21, 2008

    * version 1.0.0

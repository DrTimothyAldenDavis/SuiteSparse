Jan 10, 2024: version 3.3.1

    * minor update to build system

Dec 30, 2023: version 3.3.0

    * major change to build system: by Markus MÃ¼tzel
    * library name change: compiled library renamed from libmongoose.so (dylib,
        etc) to libsuitesparse_mongoose.so, to avoid name conflict with the
        mongoose web server (https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose).  That
        package is in C, and its user-visible functions are all prefixed mg_*,
        and an #include file of mongoose.h.  This SuiteSparse/Mongoose library
        is in C++, with a namespace of Mongoose::, and an #include file of
        Mongoose.hpp.  So the function names and include files do not conflict.
        The web mongoose project does not create any *Config.cmake files, but
        they might in the future, so the cmake and pkg-config files here have
        been renamed from Mongoose*.cmake, etc, to SuiteSparse_Mongoose*.cmake.

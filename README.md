About the BLAS and LAPACK libraries
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Use of the Intel MKL BLAS is strongly recommended.  In a 2019 test,
OpenBLAS caused result in severe performance degradation.  The reason for this
is being investigated, and this may be resolved in the near future.

To select your BLAS/LAPACK, see the instructions in SuiteSparseBLAS.cmake in
`SuiteSparse_config/cmake_modules`.  If `SuiteSparse_config` finds a BLAS with
64-bit integers (such as the Intel MKL ilp64 BLAS), it configures
`SuiteSparse_config.h` with the `SUITESPARSE_BLAS_INT` defined as `int64_t`.
Otherwise, if a 32-bit BLAS is found, this type is defined as `int32_t`.  If
later on, UMFPACK, CHOLMOD, or SPQR are compiled and linked  with a BLAS that
has a different integer size, you must override the definition with -DBLAS64
(to assert the use of 64-bit integers in the BLAS) or -DBLAS32, (to assert the
use of 32-bit integers in the BLAS).

When distributed in a binary form (such as a Debian, Ubuntu, Spack, or Brew
package), SuiteSparse should probably be compiled to expect a 32-bit BLAS,
since this is the most common case.  The default is to use a 32-bit BLAS, but
this can be changed in SuiteSparseBLAS.cmake or by compiling with
`-DALLOW_64BIT_BLAS=1`.

By default, SuiteSparse hunts for a suitable BLAS library.  To enforce a
particular BLAS library use either:

    CMAKE_OPTIONS="-DBLA_VENDOR=OpenBLAS" make
    cd Package ; cmake -DBLA_VENDOR=OpenBLAS .. make

To use the default (hunt for a BLAS), do not set `BLA_VENDOR`, or set it to
ANY.  In this case, if `ALLOW_64BIT_BLAS` is set, preference is given to a
64-bit BLAS, but a 32-bit BLAS library will be used if no 64-bit library is
found.

When selecting a particular BLAS library, the `ALLOW_64BIT_BLAS` setting is
strictly followed.  If set to true, only a 64-bit BLAS library will be used.
If false (the default), only a 32-bit BLAS library will be used.  If no such
BLAS is found, the build will fail.

    GraphBLAS   graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra.
                https://graphblas.org
                author: Tim Davis

    SPEX        solves sparse linear systems in exact arithmetic.
                Requires the GNU GMP and MPRF libraries.
                This will be soon replaced by a more general package, SPEX v3
                that includes this method (exact sparse LU) and others (sparse
                exact Cholesky, and sparse exact update/downdate).  The API
                of v3 will be changing significantly.

    CSparse     a concise sparse matrix package, developed for my
                book, "Direct Methods for Sparse Linear Systems",
                published by SIAM.  Intended primarily for teaching.
                Note that the code is (c) Tim Davis, as stated in the book.
                For production, use CXSparse instead.  In particular, both
                CSparse and CXSparse have the same include filename: cs.h.
                This package is used for the built-in DMPERM in MATLAB.
                author: Tim Davis

    CXSparse    CSparse Extended.  Includes support for complex matrices
                and both int or long integers.  Use this instead of CSparse
                for production use; it creates a libcsparse.so (or *dylib on
                the Mac) with the same name as CSparse.  It is a superset
                of CSparse.  Any code that links against CSparse should
                also be able to link against CXSparse instead.

    lib         'make install' places shared libraries for each package
                here, after 'make local'

    Makefile    to compile all of SuiteSparse

                make            compiles SuiteSparse libraries.
                                Subsequent "make install" will install
                                in just /usr/local/lib.
                                Normally requires "sudo make install"

                make both       compiles SuiteSparse, and then "make install"
                                will instal in both ./lib and /usr/local/lib
                                (the latter controlled by CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH).
                                Normally requires "sudo make install"

                make local      compiles SuiteSparse.
                                Subsequent "make install will install only
                                in ./lib, ./include only.  No sudo required.
                                Does not install in /usr/local/lib.

                make global     compiles SuiteSparse libraries.
                                Subsequent "make install" will install in
                                just /usr/local/lib (or whatever your
                                CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is).
                                Normally requires "sudo make install"
                                Does not install in ./lib and ./include.

                make install    installs in the current directory
                                (./lib, ./include), and/or in
                                /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include,
                                depending on whether "make", "make local",
                                "make global", or "make both",
                                etc has been done.

                make uninstall  undoes 'make install'

                make distclean  removes all files not in distribution, including
                                ./bin, ./share, ./lib, and ./include.

                make purge      same as 'make distclean'

                make clean      removes all files not in distribution, but
                                keeps compiled libraries and demoes, ./lib,
                                ./share, and ./include.

                Each individual package also has each of the above 'make'
                targets.

                Things you don't need to do:
                make docs       creates user guides from LaTeX files
                make cov        runs statement coverage tests (Linux only)

Some codes optionally use METIS 5.1.0.  This package is located in SuiteSparse
in the `CHOLMOD/SuiteSparse_metis` directory.  Its use is optional.  To compile
CHOLMOD without it, use the CMAKE_OPTIONS="-DNPARTITION=1" setting.  The use of
METIS can improve ordering quality for some matrices, particularly large 3D
discretizations.  METIS has been slightly modified for use in SuiteSparse; see
the `CHOLMOD/SuiteSparse_metis/README.txt` file for details.

Refer to each package for license, copyright, and author information.  All
codes are authored or co-authored by Timothy A. Davis (email: davis@tamu.edu),
except for METIS, which is by George Karypis.

Licenses for each package are located in the following files, all in
PACKAGENAME/Doc/License.txt, and these files are also concatenated into
the top-level LICENSE.txt file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK START FOR MATLAB USERS (Linux or Mac):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uncompress the SuiteSparse.zip or SuiteSparse.tar.gz archive file (they contain
the same thing).  Suppose you place SuiteSparse in the /home/me/SuiteSparse
folder.

Add the SuiteSparse/lib folder to your run-time library path.  On Linux, add
this to your ~/.bashrc script, assuming /home/me/SuiteSparse is the location of
your copy of SuiteSparse:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/me/SuiteSparse/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

For the Mac, use this instead, in your ~/.zshrc script, assuming you place
SuiteSparse in /Users/me/SuiteSparse:

    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/Users/me/SuiteSparse/lib
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

Compile all of SuiteSparse with "make local".

Next, compile the GraphBLAS MATLAB library.  In the system shell while in the
SuiteSparse folder, type "make gbmatlab" if you want to install it system- wide
with "sudo make install", or "make gblocal" if you want to use the library in
your own SuiteSparse/lib.

Then in the MATLAB Command Window, cd to the SuiteSparse directory and type
`SuiteSparse_install`.  All packages will be compiled, and several demos will be
run.  To run a (long!) exhaustive test, do `SuiteSparse_test`.

Save your MATLAB path for future sessions with the MATLAB pathtool or savepath
commands.  If those methods fail because you don't have system-wide permission,
add the new paths to your startup.m file, normally in
Documents/MATLAB/startup.m.  You can also use the `SuiteSparse_paths` m-file to
set all your paths at the start of each MATLAB session.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK START FOR THE C/C++ LIBRARIES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Linux and Mac: type the following in this directory (requires system
priviledge to do the `sudo make install`):

    make
    sudo make install

All libraries will be created and copied into SuiteSparse/lib and into
/usr/local/lib.  All include files need by the applications that use
SuiteSparse are copied into SuiteSparse/include and into /usr/local/include.

For Windows, import each `*/CMakeLists.txt` file into MS Visual Studio.

Be sure to first install all required libraries:  BLAS and LAPACK for UMFPACK,
CHOLMOD, and SPQR, and GMP and MPFR for SPEX.  Be sure to use the latest
libraries; SPEX requires MPFR 4.0.2 and GMP 6.1.2 (these version numbers
do NOT correspond to the X.Y.Z suffix of libgmp.so.X.Y.Z and libmpfr.so.X.Y.Z;
see the SPEX user guide for details).

To compile the libraries and install them only in SuiteSparse/lib (not
/usr/local/lib), do this instead in the top-level of SuiteSparse:

    make local

If you add /home/me/SuiteSparse/lib to your library search path
(`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in Linux), you can do the following (for example):

    S = /home/me/SuiteSparse
    cc myprogram.c -I$(S)/include -lumfpack -lamd -lcholmod -lsuitesparseconfig -lm

To change the C and C++ compilers, and to compile in parallel use:

    CC=gcc CX=g++ JOBS=32 make

for example, which changes the compiler to gcc and g++, and runs make with
'make -j32', in parallel with 32 jobs.

This will work on Linux/Unix and the Mac.  It should automatically detect if
you have the Intel compilers or not, and whether or not you have CUDA.

NOTE: Use of the Intel MKL BLAS is strongly recommended.  The OpenBLAS can
(rarely) result in severe performance degradation, in CHOLMOD in particular.
The reason for this is still under investigation and might already be resolved
in the current version of OpenBLAS.  See
`SuiteSparse_config/cmake_modules/SuiteSparsePolicy.cmake` to select your BLAS.

You may also need to add SuiteSparse/lib to your path.  If your copy of
SuiteSparse is in /home/me/SuiteSparse, for example, then add this to your
~/.bashrc file:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/me/SuiteSparse/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

For the Mac, use this instead:

    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/me/SuiteSparse/lib
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

Python interface

See scikit-sparse and scikit-umfpack for the Python interface via SciPy:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation options
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can set specific options for CMake with the command (for example):

    CMAKE_OPTIONS="-DNPARTITION=1 -DNSTATIC=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" make

That command will compile all of SuiteSparse except for CHOLMOD/Partition
Module.  Debug mode will be used.  The static libraries will not be built
(NSTATIC is true).

    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:   Default: "Release", use "Debug" for debugging.

    ENABLE_CUDA:        if set to true, CUDA is enabled for the project.
                        Default: true for CHOLMOD and SPQR; false otherwise

    GLOBAL_INSTALL:     if true, "make install" will install
                        into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include.
                        Default: true

    LOCAL_INSTALL:      if true, "make install" will install
                        into SuiteSparse/lib and SuiteSparse/include.
                        Default: false

    NSTATIC:            if true, static libraries are not built.
                        Default: false, except for GraphBLAS, which
                        takes a long time to compile so the default for
                        GraphBLAS is true.  For Mongoose, the NSTATIC setting
                        is treated as if it always false, since the mongoose
                        program is built with the static library.

    SUITESPARSE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES:  a string, such as "all" or
                        "35;50;75;80" that lists the CUDA architectures to use
                        when compiling CUDA kernels with nvcc.  The "all"
                        option requires cmake 3.23 or later.
                        Default: "52;75;80".

    BLA_VENDOR          a string.  Leave unset, or use "ANY" to select any BLAS
                        library (the default).  Or set to the name of a
                        BLA_VENDOR defined by FindBLAS.cmake.  See:
                        https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindBLAS.html#blas-lapack-vendors

    ALLOW_64BIT_BLAS    if true: look for a 64-bit BLAS.  If false: 32-bit only.
                        Default: false.

    NOPENMP             if true: OpenMP is not used.  Default: false.
                        UMFPACK, CHOLMOD, SPQR, and GraphBLAS will be slow.
                        Note that BLAS and LAPACK may still use OpenMP
                        internally; if you wish to disable OpenMP in an entire
                        application, select a single-threaded BLAS/LAPACK.
                        WARNING: GraphBLAS may not be thread-safe if built
                        without OpenMP (see the User Guide for details).

    DEMO                if true: build the demo programs for each package.
                        Default: false.

Additional options are available within specific packages:

    NCHOLMOD            if true, UMFPACK and KLU do not use CHOLMOD for
                        additional (optional) ordering options

CHOLMOD is composed of a set of Modules that can be independently selected;
all options default to false:

    NGL                 if true: do not build any GPL-licensed module
                        (MatrixOps, Modify, Supernodal, and GPU modules)
    NCHECK              if true: do not build the Check module.
    NMATRIXOPS          if true: do not build the MatrixOps module.
    NCHOLESKY           if true: do not build the Cholesky module.
                        This also disables the Supernodal and Modify modules.
    NMODIFY             if true: do not build the Modify module.
    NCAMD               if true: do not link against CAMD and CCOLAMD.
                        This also disables the Partition module.
    NPARTITION          if true: do not build the Partition module.
    NSUPERNODAL         if true: do not build the Supernodal module.

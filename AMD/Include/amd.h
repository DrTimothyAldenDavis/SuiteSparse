/* AMD finds a symmetric ordering P of a matrix A so that the Cholesky
 * factorization of P*A*P' has fewer nonzeros and takes less work than the
 * Cholesky factorization of A.  If A is not symmetric, then it performs its
 * ordering on the matrix A+A'.  Two sets of user-callable routines are
 * provided, one for int32_t integers and the other for int64_t integers.
 *
 * The method is based on the approximate minimum degree algorithm, discussed
 * in Amestoy, Davis, and Duff, "An approximate degree ordering algorithm",
 * SIAM Journal of Matrix Analysis and Applications, vol. 17, no. 4, pp.
 * 886-905, 1996.  This package can perform both the AMD ordering (with
 * aggressive absorption), and the AMDBAR ordering (without aggressive
 * absorption) discussed in the above paper.  This package differs from the
 * Fortran codes discussed in the paper:
 *
 *       (1) it can ignore "dense" rows and columns, leading to faster run times
 *       (2) it computes the ordering of A+A' if A is not symmetric
 *       (3) it is followed by a depth-first post-ordering of the assembly tree
 *           (or supernodal elimination tree)
 *
 * For historical reasons, the Fortran versions, amd.f and amdbar.f, have
 * been left (nearly) unchanged.  They compute the identical ordering as
 * described in the above paper.

/* Input arguments (not modified):
 *
 *      n: the matrix A is n-by-n.
 *      Ap: an int32_t/int64_t array of size n+1, containing column
 *          pointers of A.
 *      Ai: an int32_t/int64_t array of size nz, containing the row
 *          indices of A, where nz = Ap [n].
 *      Control:  a double array of size AMD_CONTROL, containing control
 *          parameters.  Defaults are used if Control is NULL.
 *
 * Output arguments (not defined on input):
 *
 *      P: an int32_t/int64_t array of size n, containing the output
 *          permutation. If row i is the kth pivot row, then P [k] = i.  In
 *          MATLAB notation, the reordered matrix is A (P,P).
 *      Info: a double array of size AMD_INFO, containing statistical
 *          information.  Ignored if Info is NULL.
 *
 * On input, the matrix A is stored in column-oriented form.  The row indices
 * of nonzero entries in column j are stored in Ai [Ap [j] ... Ap [j+1]-1].
 *
 * If the row indices appear in ascending order in each column, and there
 * are no duplicate entries, then amd_order is slightly more efficient in
 * terms of time and memory usage.  If this condition does not hold, a copy
 * of the matrix is created (where these conditions do hold), and the copy is
 * ordered.
 * 
 * Row indices must be in the range 0 to
 * n-1.  Ap [0] must be zero, and thus nz = Ap [n] is the number of nonzeros
 * in A.  The array Ap is of size n+1, and the array Ai is of size nz = Ap [n].
 * The matrix does not need to be symmetric, and the diagonal does not need to
 * be present (if diagonal entries are present, they are ignored except for
 * the output statistic Info [AMD_NZDIAG]).  The arrays Ai and Ap are not
 * modified.  This form of the Ap and Ai arrays to represent the nonzero
 * pattern of the matrix A is the same as that used internally by MATLAB.
 * If you wish to use a more flexible input structure, please see the
 * umfpack_*_triplet_to_col routines in the UMFPACK package, at
 * http://www.suitesparse.com.
 *
 * Restrictions:  n >= 0.  Ap [0] = 0.  Ap [j] <= Ap [j+1] for all j in the
 *      range 0 to n-1.  nz = Ap [n] >= 0.  Ai [0..nz-1] must be in the range 0
 *      to n-1.  Finally, Ai, Ap, and P must not be NULL.  If any of these
 *      restrictions are not met, AMD returns AMD_INVALID.
 *
 * AMD returns:
 *
 *      AMD_OK if the matrix is valid and sufficient memory can be allocated to
 *          perform the ordering.
 *
 *      AMD_OUT_OF_MEMORY if not enough memory can be allocated.
 *
 *      AMD_INVALID if the input arguments n, Ap, Ai are invalid, or if P is
 *          NULL.
 *
 *      AMD_OK_BUT_JUMBLED if the matrix had unsorted columns, and/or duplicate
 *          entries, but was otherwise valid.
 *
 * The AMD routine first forms the pattern of the matrix A+A', and then
 * computes a fill-reducing ordering, P.  If P [k] = i, then row/column i of
 * the original is the kth pivotal row.  In MATLAB notation, the permuted
 * matrix is A (P,P), except that 0-based indexing is used instead of the
 * 1-based indexing in MATLAB.
 *
 * The Control array is used to set various parameters for AMD.  If a NULL
 * pointer is passed, default values are used.  The Control array is not
 * modified.
 *
 *      Control [AMD_DENSE]:  controls the threshold for "dense" rows/columns.
 *          A dense row/column in A+A' can cause AMD to spend a lot of time in
 *          ordering the matrix.  If Control [AMD_DENSE] >= 0, rows/columns
 *          with more than Control [AMD_DENSE] * sqrt (n) entries are ignored
 *          during the ordering, and placed last in the output order.  The
 *          default value of Control [AMD_DENSE] is 10.  If negative, no
 *          rows/columns are treated as "dense".  Rows/columns with 16 or
 *          fewer off-diagonal entries are never considered "dense".
 *
 *      Control [AMD_AGGRESSIVE]: controls whether or not to use aggressive
 *          absorption, in which a prior element is absorbed into the current
 *          element if is a subset of the current element, even if it is not
 *          adjacent to the current pivot element (refer to Amestoy, Davis,
 *          & Duff, 1996, for more details).  The default value is nonzero,
 *          which means to perform aggressive absorption.  This nearly always
 *          leads to a better ordering (because the approximate degrees are
 *          more accurate) and a lower execution time.  There are cases where
 *          it can lead to a slightly worse ordering, however.  To turn it off,
 *          set Control [AMD_AGGRESSIVE] to 0.
 *
 *      Control [2..4] are not used in the current version, but may be used in
 *          future versions.
 *
 * The Info array provides statistics about the ordering on output.  If it is
 * not present, the statistics are not returned.  This is not an error
 * condition.
 * 
 *      Info [AMD_STATUS]:  the return value of AMD, either AMD_OK,
 *          AMD_OK_BUT_JUMBLED, AMD_OUT_OF_MEMORY, or AMD_INVALID.
 *
 *      Info [AMD_N]: n, the size of the input matrix
 *
 *      Info [AMD_NZ]: the number of nonzeros in A, nz = Ap [n]
 *
 *      Info [AMD_SYMMETRY]:  the symmetry of the matrix A.  It is the number
 *          of "matched" off-diagonal entries divided by the total number of
 *          off-diagonal entries.  An entry A(i,j) is matched if A(j,i) is also
 *          an entry, for any pair (i,j) for which i != j.  In MATLAB notation,
 *              S = spones (A) ;
 *              B = tril (S, -1) + triu (S, 1) ;
 *              symmetry = nnz (B & B') / nnz (B) ;
 *
 *      Info [AMD_NZDIAG]: the number of entries on the diagonal of A.
 *
 *      Info [AMD_NZ_A_PLUS_AT]:  the number of nonzeros in A+A', excluding the
 *          diagonal.  If A is perfectly symmetric (Info [AMD_SYMMETRY] = 1)
 *          with a fully nonzero diagonal, then Info [AMD_NZ_A_PLUS_AT] = nz-n
 *          (the smallest possible value).  If A is perfectly unsymmetric
 *          (Info [AMD_SYMMETRY] = 0, for an upper triangular matrix, for
 *          example) with no diagonal, then Info [AMD_NZ_A_PLUS_AT] = 2*nz
 *          (the largest possible value).
 *
 *      Info [AMD_NDENSE]: the number of "dense" rows/columns of A+A' that were
 *          removed from A prior to ordering.  These are placed last in the
 *          output order P.
 *
 *      Info [AMD_MEMORY]: the amount of memory used by AMD, in bytes.  In the
 *          current version, this is 1.2 * Info  [AMD_NZ_A_PLUS_AT] + 9*n
 *          times the size of an integer.  This is at most 2.4nz + 9n.  This
 *          excludes the size of the input arguments Ai, Ap, and P, which have
 *          a total size of nz + 2*n + 1 integers.
 *
 *      Info [AMD_NCMPA]: the number of garbage collections performed.
 *
 *      Info [AMD_LNZ]: the number of nonzeros in L (excluding the diagonal).
 *          This is a slight upper bound because mass elimination is combined
 *          with the approximate degree update.  It is a rough upper bound if
 *          there are many "dense" rows/columns.  The rest of the statistics,
 *          below, are also slight or rough upper bounds, for the same reasons.
 *          The post-ordering of the assembly tree might also not exactly
 *          correspond to a true elimination tree postordering.
 *
 *      Info [AMD_NDIV]: the number of divide operations for a subsequent LDL'
 *          or LU factorization of the permuted matrix A (P,P).
 *
 *      Info [AMD_NMULTSUBS_LDL]:  the number of multiply-subtract pairs for a
 *          subsequent LDL' factorization of A (P,P).
 *
 *      Info [AMD_NMULTSUBS_LU]:  the number of multiply-subtract pairs for a
 *          subsequent LU factorization of A (P,P), assuming that no numerical
 *          pivoting is required.
 *
 *      Info [AMD_DMAX]:  the maximum number of nonzeros in any column of L,
 *          including the diagonal.
 *
 *      Info [14..19] are not used in the current version, but may be used in
 *          future versions.

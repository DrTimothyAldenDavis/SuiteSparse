    * port: to 32-bit systems

Version 1.0.2: Aug 2, 2023

    * CONTRIBUTING.md: renamed the file
    * CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: added, from https://www.contributor-covenant.org
    * FindGraphBLAS.cmake and FindLAGraph.cmake: revised to find both dynamic
        and static libraries, and to find the version number from the include
        file if it's not present in the filename of the library.
    * LAGraph_FastGraphletTransform: now able to compile it when OpenMP
        is not available.
    * bug fix: LAGRAPH_VANILLA option fixed.  Added "make vanilla" to the

        GraphBLAS.

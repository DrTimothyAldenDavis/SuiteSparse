    * CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: added, from https://www.contributor-covenant.org
    * FindGraphBLAS.cmake and FindLAGraph.cmake: revised to find both dynamic
        and static libraries, and to find the version number from the include
        file if it's not present in the filename of the library.
    * LAGraph_FastGraphletTransform: now able to compile it when OpenMP
        is not available.
